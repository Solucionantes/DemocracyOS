# DemocracyOS
This is a conceptual approach on a user-friendly, open-source, vote and debate tool, crafted for parliaments, parties and decision-making institutions that will allow citizens to get informed, join the conversation and vote on topics, just how they want their representatives to vote.   In Solucionantes we created a webapp prototype for DemocracyOS using a Design Thinking Process and several User Experience Design methodologies.   This is the repository of the deliverables that the Team Aition has created from August to December of 2014.
